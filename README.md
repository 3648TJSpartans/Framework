# Team 3648 Java FRC Framework

Welcome to the Team 3648 Java FRC Framework! This is a command-based framework that allows teams to easily program their robot using Java for the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). This framework is designed to simplify the programming process and make it easier for teams to focus on building their robot.
## Features
<ul>
    <li>Uses XML files to store hardware constants such as ports, motor controller type, control mode, etc.</li>
    <li>Controller mapping for easy joystick input mapping.</li>
    <li>Autonomous program writing using a command-based system.</li>
    <li>Generic commands like Motor_Set or Motor Default, as well as specialized subsystem commands that can be added.</li>
</ul>

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

<ul>
    <li>Java Development Kit (JDK) version 11 or higher.</li>
    <li>FRC RoboRio and a compatible motor controller.</li>
</ul>

## Installation

<ol>
    <li>Clone or download the repository.</li>
    <li>Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.</li>
    <li>Build the project using Maven.</li>
</ol>

## Usage

For more information on how to use the Framework, please visit out [wiki](https://github.com/3648TJSpartans/Framework/wiki).

<ol>
    <li>Define your robot hardware constants in the XML files located in the src/main/java/frc/robot/Robot.java file.</li>
    <li>Write your autonomous program in the src/main/deploy/auton folder.</li>
    <li>Deploy the code to your robot and run it.</li>
    <li>Monitor the robot through shuffle board and terminal.</li>
</ol>
