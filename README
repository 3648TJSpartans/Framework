Robot Controller Configuration

This document describes the XML configuration file for a robot controller. The configuration file specifies the different subsystems of the robot and the actions that can be performed by the operator using a Logitech controller.
XML Declaration

The configuration file starts with an XML declaration that specifies the version of XML being used.

xml

<?xml version="1.0"?>

Robot Element

The main element in the configuration file is the robot element. This element contains one or more controller elements, each of which represents a controller connected to the robot.

xml

<robot>
  <!-- controller elements go here -->
</robot>

Controller Element

The controller element specifies a Logitech controller connected to a particular port and identified as the copilot's controller. It also contains one or more defaultCommand elements and button elements.

xml

<controller type="LOGITECH" port="1" id="COPILOT">
  <!-- defaultCommand elements go here -->
  <!-- button elements go here -->
</controller>

The type attribute specifies the type of controller being used. In this case, it is a Logitech controller. The port attribute specifies the port number that the controller is connected to, and the id attribute specifies the identifier for the controller.
DefaultCommand Element

The defaultCommand element specifies a default command that should be executed when the corresponding axis on the controller is moved. It has several attributes including subsystemID which specifies the subsystem that the command should be executed on, axisReference which specifies the axis on the controller, command which specifies the command to execute, deadzone which specifies the deadzone for the axis, inverted which specifies whether the axis should be inverted, and scale which specifies the scaling factor for the command.

xml

<defaultCommand subsystemID="armChain" axisReference="LEFT_JOYSTICK_X" command="Motor_Default" deadzone=".2" inverted="true" scale=".7"></defaultCommand>

Button Element

The button element represents a button on the controller that can trigger an action. It has several attributes including button which specifies the button ID, type which specifies the type of action to perform, command which specifies the command to execute, trigger which specifies when the command should be executed, and subsystemID attributes which specify the subsystems that the command should be executed on.

xml

<button button="A" type="transport" command="scorePos" trigger="Pressed" armSubsystemID="arm" armChainSubsystemID="armChain" wristSubsystemID="wrist" clawSubsystemID="claw"></button>

The trigger attribute specifies when the command should be executed. The options are Pressed, Held, WhenHeld, Released, and Toggle. Each of these options specifies a different behavior for the command when the button is pressed or released.
Conclusion

This document provides a configuration for a robot controller that specifies how the different subsystems of the robot should respond to user input from a Logitech controller. The configuration can be modified to add or remove commands and buttons as needed.
