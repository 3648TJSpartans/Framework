integrate shuffleboard into the framework for easy of testing and for in game changes. somewhat done already. Needs testing. Needs to dynamically pick value as well

Finish generic tank drive subsystem & commands (and swerve)
Finish generic velocity/position motor(s) subsystem & commands. Toggle. Coast/break? Hold (with off)
Create generic solenoid(s) subsystem & commands. Set state. Toggle. Hold (with default) Inverse input.


--All subsystems should support reloading of config. Config reload should be a command.  (Kinda done - maybe button to just run code to restart entire robot?)


Create controller util class. button debounce, deadband, linear/non-linear mapping of input to output. In Controller config
create logging class. Time/mode/+otherstuff.


failsafe for sensors solienoid and motors might need testing
-Need to add more properties or expand defaultValue architecture

make a compressor object

RobotInit->controllers/auton/robotxml -- builds out commands for input/auton and starts subsystems
Subsystem->subsystemcollection->motors/solenids/etc.
